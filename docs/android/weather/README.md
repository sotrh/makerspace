# Android Weather App

This will be your introduction the wonderful world of Android app development! Android apps are a staple of the tech industry. Most big name companies have one, so the skills involved are in high demand.

There are 2 main programming languages used when making an Android app, Java, and Kotlin. Kotlin is the officially endorsed language by Google and the Android Team, so that's the one we'll be using. If you want some reference on Kotlin you can check out the [kotlin guide](/kotlin/) included on this site. I'd argue that the [kotlin language reference](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-syntax.html) is more complete, but it's good to have options.

With that said, let's get started!
