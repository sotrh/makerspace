# Game Dev Resources

Game dev is a complex topic. People study for years to become a game dev, so don't think that this is a comprehensive guide.

## Unity

The industry standard as of writing. Most game dev positions expect competency with Unity. Getting started with Unity is pretty easy. Visit [their website](https://store.unity.com/#plans-individual) to select a plan and download the Engine.

<div class="note">

Unity is free for students, and free for personal development as long as you make less than $100K per year on your games.

As far as learning how to use Unity, there are a plethora of tutorials on Youtube and accross the internet. [Googling "Unity tutorial"](https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&sxsrf=ALeKk00VQM0MoMEtn37J14JDhDfVuArvtA%3A1593469895402&source=hp&ei=x2v6XoD1E4G0tQaVnbKADA&q=unity+tutorial&oq=unity+tutorial&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAA6BwgjEOoCECc6BAgjECc6BQgAELEDOgQIABBDOgcIABCxAxBDUJcZWJUoYLQsaAFwAHgAgAHrAYgBog-SAQYwLjEyLjKYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6sAEK&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjA9Mj4iajqAhUBWs0KHZWODMAQ4dUDCAg&uact=5) alone yields about 76 million results.

Some of these may or may not be outdated though, so I tend to prefer Unity's own tutorials at [learn.unity.com](https://learn.unity.com/).

Unity uses [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) for it's scripting language, so you're going to need some basic programming knowledge to get things working.

<div class="note">

Unity has some [visual scripting tools](https://unity.com/how-to/make-games-without-programming), but they are currently paid only.

## Unreal Engine

Often put head-to-head with Unity, Unreal is also industry standard. This is the engine they used to build [Fortnite](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home). You can get it at [https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/get-now](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/get-now).

While Unreal uses [C/C++](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/index.htm) as it's language of choice (which is quite advanced), you can also Unreal's [blueprint system](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Blueprints/index.html) to code your game visually.

<div class="note">

You may still have to dip into C++ if you need something that Blueprints can't do, or especially if you want to apply for a job that uses Unreal Engine.

## Godot

One of my favorite engines, Godot is completely free to use. When you download it you own everything. Not just your game code, but the engine code as well. Get it here [https://godotengine.org/](https://godotengine.org/).

Godot has a [visual scripting system](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/visual_script/getting_started.html) as well as it's custom [GDScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html). They've recently even added [C# support](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_basics.html).

<div class="note">

It's best to stick to one scripting system. Having multiple languages can make figuring out what's going on more difficult.
