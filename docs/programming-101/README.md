# Welcome to Programming!

For the uninitiated, programming can appear really daunting. A lot of people think that they aren't smart enough to be a programmer. The truth is, like anything, there are various levels of programming skill, and various things that you can do with it. You don't need to be "smart", to be a programmer. What you do need is patience and a drive to learn.

## Pragmatic Learning

My philosophy on learning is that you should pace yourself. Let's say you want to learn to play an instrument. The first question you should be asking yourself is, "What do I want to use this for?". Use this to set your pace. It makes no sense to pay for expensive lessons, and practice for hours a day if you just want to learn to play your favorite songs for fun.

A lot of people get burnt out trying to "be the best" at what they intend to use as a hobby. You don't need a degree in Italian linguistics to vacation to Rome. You just need to know how to ask for common things like "where's the bathroom?".

You can always change your goal with programming. You can start just learning for fun, then trying to get a job. The reverse is also just as valid.

## Take your time

I am primarily self taught. That doesn't mean that I spent **all** of my time programming. Don't get me wrong, I love programming and spend plenty of time doing it/reading about it, but the brain can only handle so much. If you feel your getting frustrated with a particular topic, come back to it later. There are no grades here, no deadlines either, so don't beat yourself up if things don't click right away.
